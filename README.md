# Employee Tracker

A content management system for companies operated from the terminal.

## Description

This project was an exercise in practicality. Every company needs a tool or tools to manage their databases and administrative processes. While it was an exercise in utility, it was also an exercise to develop my ability to utilize a SQL database, and develop a tool
that allows a user to add, remove, and update from a database. This is a tool for content management for a company: it allows the user to add departments, roles, and employees to a database, as well as view them. Through this project, I learned how to send queries with specific user input to a database in order to return or modify data in that database, which is crucial to a company's functioning.

## Installation

Run the command 'npm i' in the terminal to acquire the required dependencies. After that, run index.js while within the Assets directory.

## Usage

After installation, run the node index.js command in the terminal. From there, you can fulfill administrative duties with the tool.
